# GIF Search

A small GIPHY browser for nixarchy-menu. Enable **Extensions > GIF Search**, type
`gif happy` and press Enter to open the grid. `gif` opens trending GIFs.
The command prefix can be changed in nixarchy-menu's generated settings screen.

- Type to search; requests wait until typing pauses for 300 ms.
- Up/Down moves between rows. Tab switches from the search field to the grid,
  where Left/Right moves between GIFs. Right at the end of the search text also
  switches into the grid and advances one GIF. Tab returns to search.
- Enter or click uses the default copy action. Ctrl+Enter or Ctrl+click uses the other.
- Previous/Next browses 24 results per page. Esc closes; Backspace in an empty
  search returns to results.
- Copy success or failure appears in the footer.

Settings in **nixarchy-menu Settings > GIF Search**:

- **Default action:** Copy image (default) or Copy link. Swaps Enter and Ctrl+Enter,
  as well as click and Ctrl+click; the footer reflects the selected action.
- **Close after copy:** No (default) or Yes. Closes only after a successful copy;
  failures keep the view open so they can be read and retried.

GIFs are copied as Wayland `image/gif` data. Whether an application pastes and
animates that format depends on the application; copy the link when needed.
Downloads over 25 MB are rejected with a message. No favorites, history, file
exports, square conversion, clips or provider picker.

## How the port works

Studied the [Raycast GIF Search source at the requested commit](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/tree/3c654737b0d566d3103fcdf72221a9f34664bdf2/extensions/gif-search):

- `search.tsx` renders a React grid with provider selection, trending, favorites
  and recents. `useSearchAPI.ts` caches and paginates provider adapters, deduping
  GIFs into a common model.
- `models/giphy.ts` calls Raycast's GIPHY proxy and maps original and preview
  image URLs. Other adapters cover Klipy, GIPHY Clips and Finer Gifs Club.
- `GifActions.tsx` offers file/link/Markdown copy, paste, download and favorites.
  `copyFileToClipboard.ts` downloads to a temporary file (or reuses the favorites
  cache) and calls Raycast's macOS clipboard API.

This is a fresh QML/Python implementation of the core workflow, following
nixarchy-menu's `CONTRIBUTING.md` extension guide and `docs/providers.md` API 1.
`core/Gifs.js` builds literal curl argv, validates results and creates the entry
row; `Service.qml` owns requests, debounce and clipboard state; `GifView.qml`
renders a three-column animated grid using host theme tokens. The Python
standard-library helper replaces macOS file copying with binary `wl-copy` input.
Only the current page is retained in memory. Outdated responses are ignored.

## Dependencies and data access

Requires the existing nixarchy-menu/Quickshell environment, Qt GIF image support,
`curl`, `python3`, and `wl-copy` (wl-clipboard). No setup or package installation.

Nothing executes while disabled. Opening the GIF grid requests trending/search
JSON from `https://gif-search.raycast.com/api/giphy`, the same public proxy the
original uses, without an API key. This is Raycast-operated infrastructure,
not a guaranteed nixarchy-menu service: availability or access may change. Search
phrases are sent to that proxy and GIPHY. Requests have a 15-second timeout and
a 2 MB response limit; errors have an explicit Retry button.

Qt loads animated previews from HTTPS GIPHY media URLs. Copying a GIF downloads
its original from GIPHY with a 20-second socket timeout, validates its GIF header
and size, then passes bytes to `wl-copy --type image/gif`. Copying a link starts
the helper and `wl-copy` without downloading media. The helper accepts only
HTTPS GIPHY URLs, including redirects. The clipboard is changed only on a copy
action. No persistent files, search history or analytics requests are written
by the extension. `wl-copy` retains ownership of the clipboard after the helper
exits, as usual. Disabling stops the extension's running processes.

## Development and verification

From the repository root:

```sh
QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=generic bin/nixarchy-menu check-extensions extensions/gif-search
python3 extensions/gif-search/tests/test_copy.py
python3 extensions/gif-search/tests/palette_check.py
```

For local discovery, link this folder into
`~/.local/share/nixarchy-menu/extensions/gif-search`, then enable it through nixarchy-menu.
Reload the shell after editing an already loaded service, as the host guide
describes. The implementation does not change nixarchy-menu's core or live settings.

Verified on 2026-09-12: extension validation/lint and QML tests, four Python
clipboard tests, and the real palette offscreen test (including keyboard input)
pass. A live search and animated preview download worked; the production helper
downloaded a 2,987,777-byte original GIF into a fake clipboard receiver. The grid
was visually inspected with that real preview. Desktop app pasting and a live
installation were not exercised.
