# Smart Match runtime

The default is **Voice and text**, using **Small (2M)**. Settings are under
Keystroke Settings > Matching. **Only voice** leaves typed queries on the ordinary
matcher. **Off** terminates the helper (including an in-progress installation),
clears pending results and releases the model; downloaded files remain for reuse.
**Large (8M)** downloads once when selected and first used. Both models run on CPU.
An idle helper also exits after two minutes and reloads on the next eligible query.

Installation from `bin/keystroke install` prepares Small. A plugin installed through
Omarchy prepares the selected model lazily on its first eligible query. Setup runs
outside the shell UI process, under the user's account, with no system package
changes, and needs network access for the first download. A failed setup keeps
lexical search working and adds a Retry Smart Match row to the Matching settings
screen. `bin/keystroke matching [small|large]` can prepare models without enabling
or restarting the plugin.

## Engine

`helpers/matching-start.py` first verifies or downloads the three model files
(`config.json`, `tokenizer.json`, `model.safetensors`) for the pinned revision
straight from Hugging Face, comparing each against the SHA-256 digest recorded in
the script; a file cached by an earlier release's `huggingface_hub` layout is reused
when its digest matches. It then serves the model through the first of:

1. `matching/bin/keystroke-matching`, the static x86_64 binary shipped with the
   plugin (700 KB, musl, no shared-library dependencies). Its manifest
   (`keystroke-matching.json`) names the machine architecture, the fingerprint
   of the engine source it was built from and the digest-pinned image it was
   built in; the binary is used only while machine and fingerprint match the
   running machine and the checked-out source. `bin/keystroke engine`
   (`matching/engine/build-prebuilt.sh`) rebuilds it in that container after an
   engine change, `tests/matching_engine_check.py` fails while it is stale, and
   CI rebuilds and byte-compares it on every push and attests it on releases
   ([docs/engine-provenance.md](../docs/engine-provenance.md)).
2. `matching/engine`, the Rust source, built once per source revision with `cargo`
   (`--locked`; about ten seconds and a dozen small crates: serde, serde_json,
   unicode-normalization, unicode_categories) into the data directory when the
   shipped binary does not apply (another architecture, or a modified engine).
   Only the finished binary is kept.
3. The Python runtime from `requirements.lock` (`uv`, hash-locked), running
   `helpers/matching-worker.py`. Same protocol, same results.

The engine is not a deep-learning framework: a Model2Vec model is one embedding
row per vocabulary token, and a text's vector is the mean of its token rows. The
engine implements the BERT WordPiece tokenizer as `tokenizers` performs it
(BertNormalizer, BertPreTokenizer, greedy WordPiece; `[UNK]` dropped as Model2Vec
does), reads the F32 table from the safetensors file and ranks by cosine.
`tests/matching_engine_check.py` builds it and proves token-for-token parity with
`tokenizers` on a synthetic vocabulary and, when installed, on the real one;
scores agree with the Python worker to within 4e-7. Measured here: 600 KB binary,
ready 18 ms after launch (about 60 ms through the start script), 16 MiB resident,
a 1,500-document catalog embedded in 5 ms, a query answered in under 0.1 ms.
The Python worker measured 92 MiB resident and about 250 ms to ready.

The engine, runtime and models live in
`${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/keystroke/matching/` (`engine/<source hash>/`,
`runtime/`, `models/<name>/<revision>/`). Model revisions and digests are fixed in
`helpers/matching-start.py`. Subsequent loading is local-only. No query or catalog
text is sent to a remote inference service or saved by the worker. Nothing is
downloaded except model files and, for a source build, the crates named in
`Cargo.lock`; no code is generated or evaluated.

A single JSON-lines worker keeps normalized static vectors in memory. Catalog
updates reuse unchanged vectors and evict removed documents. Requests contain
only stable IDs and metadata, not executable actions. Replies contain IDs and
similarity scores. The host filters availability and scope before sending metadata
and maps replies back onto fresh provider rows. Each query/catalog/model has its
own request key; old responses cannot populate a newer query. Only the latest
queued query is kept while a request is in flight. The catalog travels with a
request only when its digest changed.

The host retains exact matching, adds bounded typo recovery and a conditional
Chrome-to-Chromium alias, and then adds semantic suggestions above fallbacks but
below exact hits before applying learned query preferences. It filters negation, command family, volume/brightness direction,
start/stop and contradictory on/off setters. A toggle is still presented as a
**Toggle**: unknown current state is never treated as a guaranteed on/off setter.
Equivalent commands are deduplicated while retaining confirmations. Results never
run automatically. Whole spoken arithmetic is parsed separately using the existing
bounded calculator; ambiguous homophones and ordinary prose are not rewritten.

`descriptions.json` is the frozen GPT-5.6 Terra annotation pass: 618 one-sentence
intent descriptions, produced from installed metadata without access to the test
queries. `description-keys.json` binds the descriptions to their original titles
and fingerprints of action/target definitions. Changed/custom/absent entries fall back to live
metadata. App IDs accept the AppLibrary's optional `.desktop` suffix. Community
providers can supply a live `catalog(ctx)` and their own `intentDescription`.
The shipped map does not create or install its catalog's apps or hotkeys.

The default ~8 MB 2M model has 64-dimensional vectors; the ~31 MB 8M model has
256-dimensional vectors. The compiled engine holds the table as is (16 MiB resident
with 2M); the Python runtime measured roughly 100/130 MiB peak process RSS. Neither
similarity nor a fixed threshold proves intent; this remains a suggestions system
with explicit selection and existing confirmation rules.
